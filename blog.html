                <p>Before ES6, the var keyword was used to declare a variable in JavaScript. The var keyword has been around since the inception of JavaScript, and it's what you will see in any pre ES6 code. Variables declared using the var keyword are either globally or functionally scoped, they do not support block-level scope.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl py-5">What is Let in JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>let in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.
                let variables are not hoisted in the same way as var, and they are not accessible before their declaration within a block.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl py-5">When to use JavaScript const?</h2>
                <p>Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed. Use const when you declare: A new Array; A new Object; A new Function ...</p>

                <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.</p>
                <p>First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices architecture.</p>
